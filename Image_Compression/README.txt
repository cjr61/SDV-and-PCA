This program was created using libraries found in Eclipse and may not work through terminal compiling. 

Most of the Project Requirements are fulfilled by running ImageCompression.java

Use the drop down arrow on the compiling button and select 'Run Configurations'. From there select the arguments tab and follow the guidelines in the project description to run the program. 

To obtain the files Header.txt and SVD.txt for an image, run the file SVD_Decomposition.java with the name of the file to be SVD'd as the argument (follow above to get to the arguments tab). The Header.txt and SVD.txt files can then be run through ImageCompression.java to fulfill the option "Yourprogram.exe 3 header.txt SVD.txt k" as outlined in the project description.
